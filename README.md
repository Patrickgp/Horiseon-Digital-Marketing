# Code Refactor Starter Code

I refactored this code so that it follows accessibility standards and to optimize the webpage for search engines. I changed/removed the excessive use of div's into semantic HTML elements for better clarity and accessibility. I restructured the HTML elements remaining so that it presents logically regardless of styling. For greater accessibility, I also provided alt attributes to all of the essential images. I changed the heading attributes so that they fall in sequential order. I removed redundant CSS selectors and applied one CSS selector as a class to multiple elements in the HTML. Lastly, the title element is concise and provides a brief description of the company Horiseon, which provides digital marketing services.
